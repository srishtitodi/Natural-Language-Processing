# Natural-Language-Processing
In the notebook NER Classification using SVM, Perceptron and Averaged perceptron, I have performed classification to identify words from the text that are named entity.The training and testing was done on two different datasets, training being done on news data and the prediction was done for email corpus.
In Document Classification using Naive Bayes, I have used imdb dataset for sentimental analysis, i.e., to classify the revies as positive or negative. This project was built from scratch without using pre-existing libraries for modelling. I have used three kinds of feature representation for the document- binary bag of words, count bag of words and TF-IDF model. Then, I have used Naive Bayes on each of them to compare the best results.
